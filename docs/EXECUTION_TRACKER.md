# Execution Tracker

Last updated: 2026-03-20

## Purpose

Operational state tracker for ndarrow implementation progress.

## Resume Protocol

1. Read `docs/README.md`.
2. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` (locked constraints).
3. Read this file for current done/next state.
4. Read `docs/architecture.md` for structural work.

| I-020 | Capability/tracker/status/nabled docs synchronized to implemented state | 10 |
| I-021 | `densify_csr_view` helper implemented with CSR invariant validation and helper tests | 8 |
| I-022 | Property-based integration tests added for dense/sparse/tensor round-trip invariants | 9 |
| I-023 | Benchmark baseline persistence/reporting refinements implemented (`bench_report.sh`, CI summary + threshold checks) | 9 |
| I-024 | Sparse/tensor allocation verification expanded in integration tests (pointer-identity zero-copy checks) | 9 |
| I-025 | `cast_f64_to_f32` finite-range failure semantics hardened with explicit overflow rejection tests | 8 |
| I-026 | Null helper APIs completed (`fill_nulls_with_zero`, `fill_nulls_with_mean`, `compact_non_null`) | 8 |

| I-029 | `FixedSizeList -> ArrayView2` masked ingress now explicitly exposes outer-row validity only and rejects inner component nulls; docs/tests synchronized | 4 |
| I-030 | First-class complex matrix and fixed-shape tensor bridge APIs implemented by composing the scalar complex carrier inside canonical dense/tensor storage | 10 |
| I-031 | Concept-family standalone / `rows-of-X` bridge matrix reviewed and narrowed-carrier slice documented; final matrix review identified two remaining carrier gaps before release | 10 |
| I-032 | `ndarrow.csr_matrix_batch` implemented with per-row `CsrView` ingress, outbound construction, registry wiring, and tests | 5 |
| I-033 | Complex `arrow.variable_shape_tensor` inbound/outbound carriers implemented by composing `ndarrow.complex32` / `ndarrow.complex64` inside canonical ragged tensor storage | 7 |
| I-034 | Checkpoint 1 fully closed: the concept-family standalone / `rows-of-X` bridge matrix is implemented and release-ready | 10 |
| I-035 | Masked per-row ingress added for canonical ragged tensor and batched CSR carriers (`variable_shape_tensor_iter_masked`, `csr_matrix_batch_iter_masked`) with tests and public re-exports | 4 |
| I-036 | Null helper family widened with `NullFill`, `fill_nulls`, and `fill_nulls_with_value`, and primitive fill paths now operate directly on raw buffers + validity bitmaps | 8 |
| I-037 | Column-level batch views added for canonical ragged tensor and batched CSR carriers (`VariableShapeTensorBatchView`, `CsrMatrixBatchView`) with `row` / `iter` / `IntoIterator` ergonomics and zero-copy tests | 4 |

## Next (Priority Order)

| ID    | Description | Phase |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| N-008 | Prepare release notes / version cut for the next `ndarrow` publication | 10 |

## Needed (Open Questions)

| ID    | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Q-001 | No open architectural questions at checkpoint 1 scope. Resume at release prep or downstream `nabled` adoption work unless new carrier gaps are discovered. |
